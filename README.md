# simple-py
This is a repo where I'm currently learrning python and i'm doing projects.
  1. the first project (Register folder) is a Registration system where it stores both username and password in a txt file.
  2. The second folder is a package folder. I've learned how to create a python package, verifying the package and using the package.
